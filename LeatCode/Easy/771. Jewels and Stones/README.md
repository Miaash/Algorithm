### 문제내용

    You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
    Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

#### Example 1 :

`Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3`

#### Example 2 :

`Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0`
