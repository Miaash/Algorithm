### 문제내용

    Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
    Return the array ans.

#### Example 1 :

`Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.`

#### Example 2 :

`Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.`
